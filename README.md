# restaurant-dashboard
This project is an interactive dashboard that analyzes restaurant food delivery sales over the last 6 months. It helps identify which city has the highest sales, what food is ordered the most, and at what time customers usually place orders.  It is built using HTML, CSS, and Chart.js and shows 5 visual charts in one clean, colorful web page.
